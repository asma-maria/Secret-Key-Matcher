<h1>Q2. 2.	What is Event Bubble and Event Delegation in JS? </h1>
<P>
  Ans: 
  Event Bubble: It is a method of event propagation in the DOM. 
  It happens when an element receives an event and the event bubbles to its parent as well as ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.
</P>
<P>
  Event Delegation: It is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently. Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element,
  we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .
  target property of the event object.

<h1>Q3.What is the difference between local storage, session storage and cookies ?</h1>
<p>Ans: Local storage: It is a web storage method that helps us to store data on the client’s computer in the form of key or value pairs in a web browser.
  The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes the
  window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's memory is cleared.

  Session storage:  It is similar to local storage but it stores data for one session. Data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

Cookies:
Cookies are small files of information that a web server generates and sends to a web browser. Web browsers stores the cookies they receive for a 
predetermined period of time. They attach the relevant cookies to any future requests the user makes of the web server. Web browsers store cookies 
in a designated file on users’ devices.
